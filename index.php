	    <p>This is an <strong>example</strong> website for an on-line book  store. The site includes a catalog of books and a facility for creating and mantaining customer accounts, complete with a shopping cart for "ordering" books.</p>
	    <p><em>Please note that this is not an actual on-line store! It is just an example - designed for a web programming course.</em></p>
	    <p>The navigation bar at the top of the page allows a visitor to browse books in the store by caterogy, or to search for a book by name. In order to "place an order", however, a customer account is required.</p>
	    <p><em>Enjoy you "shopping" experience!</em></p>
